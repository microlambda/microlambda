## Developer documentation

The project is maintained as a monorepo (using yarn workspaces) and contains the following packages:

* `@microlambda/core` Core package that contains all low-level logic to run microlambda projects.
* `@microlambda/cli` A command line interface that provides tooling to generate, run, test and deploy projects.
* `@microlambda/generator` A command line interface that provides tooling to generate, run, test and deploy projects.
* `@microlambda/client` The web UI to monitor and interact with the microservices during local runs.
* `@microlambda/server` The WebSocket server that send data to client and handle its requests for local run UI.
* `@microlambda/handling` Helpers that automates repetitive tasks such as CORS configuration, build responses.
* `@microlambda/testing` Tests helpers for easy unit and functional tests setup.

### Project first build

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:microlambda/microlambda.git

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Mila is designed to build itself, to do so, build mila-runner
yarn build:runner

# Once the runner is built, use it to build the entire project
yarn build --watch
```

To perform tests, fork the [mila-starter](https://github.com/microlambda/mila-starter) or use one of your microlambda project.

Update your ``package.json`` to use yarn `link:` special protocol and use your local version of mila and run `yarn install`.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@microlambda/cli": "link:/path/to/your/clone/microlambda/cli",
    "serverless-microlambda": "link:/path/to/your/clone/microlambda/plugin"
  }
}
```

With this setup, you are using a local version of microlambda which is rebuilt with `build --watch` on another shell.

When you edit microlambda, changes are immediately available on your test project.

You have a proper DX to fix a bug or develop a new feature :triangular_ruler:
