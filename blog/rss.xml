            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After several years of work on a sizable serverless platform, our team has, with the approval of our sponsors, publicly
released our internal build and deployment orchestration framework.</p><p>This framework draws inspiration from a suite of tools developed for a specific project with unique requirements and
topology. We have worked tirelessly to make it as flexible and agnostic as possible.</p><p>We are very proud of this effort and hope to see it adopted and enhanced by many members of the community.</p><p>This initial official release is still marked as a release candidate for a few weeks, allowing us time to finish writing
our documentation and conducting more extensive testing.</p><p>Nevertheless, Microlambda powers applications running in production for several years, and you can already
kickstart your project.</p><p>Feel free to ask questions or suggest improvements on our GitHub repository.</p>]]></content:encoded>
