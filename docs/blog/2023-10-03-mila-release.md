After several years of work on a sizable serverless platform, our team has, with the approval of our sponsors, publicly
released our internal build and deployment orchestration framework.

This framework draws inspiration from a suite of tools developed for a specific project with unique requirements and
topology. We have worked tirelessly to make it as flexible and agnostic as possible.

We are very proud of this effort and hope to see it adopted and enhanced by many members of the community.

This initial official release is still marked as a release candidate for a few weeks, allowing us time to finish writing
our documentation and conducting more extensive testing.

Nevertheless, Microlambda powers applications running in production for several years, and you can already
kickstart your project.

Feel free to ask questions or suggest improvements on our GitHub repository.
